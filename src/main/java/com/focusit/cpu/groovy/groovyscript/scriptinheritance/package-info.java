 * This example demonstrates how to mix desired class capabilities with dynamic groovy script via Custom Script Base Class.
 * And call just required method(-s) without groovy's Meta Object Protocol
 * <p>
 * It can be used in case when you want to get more performance and avoid script bindings in favor of POJO setters.
